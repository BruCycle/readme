What could make biking more fun, you ask? Beer, of course! 

Ever had one of those days where an all day brewery crawl leaves you feeling bloated, gassy, and deeply unwell? BrüCycle was developed as a way for you to track your biking exercise data via Strava, and the number of beers that you have consumed during said exercise. You will accumulate beers in your Beer Bank based on the exercise you've completed. #this is a work in progress. make it fun, good looking!!! :poop:
